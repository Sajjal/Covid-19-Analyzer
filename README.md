# Welcome

### Thank you for exploring COVID-19 Analyzer.

It is a lightweight application to analyze COVID-19 Statistics.

This application is developed using Node.js, Express.js, Cheerio.js, Chart.js, and some basic HTML and CSS. Data is retrieved by scraping Worldometers.info. The user interface is responsive and minimal.

**Feel free to Clone and Fork. Commercial Distribution is Prohibited.**

## Background (_Why this application was developed?_)

After completing **S & D Budget-Sheet** `https://github.com/Sajjal/Budget-Sheet`
I was looking for ideas to keep practicing. Several ideas came to my mind such as:

1. Home Inventory Tracker `[Wife said she won't have time to input data all the time]`.
2. Movie Recommender `[Unsatisfactory Value Proposition]`.
3. Youtube Radio `[Still Under Consideration]`.
4. Covid-19 Analyzer `[New Technologies to learn, viable and fun. Perfect]`.

and here it is.
